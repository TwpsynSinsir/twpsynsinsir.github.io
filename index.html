        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Calum Wicks. I'm 28 years old, and I currently live in
          Auckland, New Zealand. While I was also born here, I grew up entirely
          in Wales, over in the UK. It's a long way geographically, but Rugby
          and Sheep are still on the menu!
        </p>
        <p>
          I grew up speaking English, however my schooling was entirely through
          the medium of Welsh, so I became fluent in both before I left for
          University. At University I studied Japanese, which I am also fluent
          in. (Just don't torment me with Keigo!)
        </p>

        <h2>Why am I studying at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <p>
          I've long suffered from an inability to choose a career path or decide
          what I wanted to be in the future. My initial job after graduation was
          teching English in Japan, but this was never meant to be a permanent
          career. After returning to New Zealand, I ping-ponged between jobs in
          construction, the university, and after-school tutoring, but nothing
          really stuck. Finally, after returning from a short study-abroad in
          Tokyo, I decided that I needed to settle on a career once and for all.
        </p>
        <p>
          After much head-scratching and soul-searching, I decided to pursue
          programming. Previously, I had been interested in this sort of career,
          and had tried on a few half-hearted occasions to learn by myself,
          however they never really led anywhere. I happened upon Dev Academy by
          chance, and after chatting with a few of the teachers and getting a
          tour of the Auckland Campus, I signed on and have been enjoying it
          immensely so far!
