            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Calum Wicks. I'm 28 years old, and I currently live in
              Auckland, New Zealand. While I was also born here, I grew up
              entirely in Wales, over in the UK. It's a long way geographically,
              but Rugby and Sheep are still on the menu!
            </p>
            <p>
              I grew up speaking English, however my schooling was entirely
              through the medium of Welsh, so I became fluent in both before I
              left for University. At University I studied Japanese, which I am
              also fluent in. (Just don't torment me with Keigo!)

            <h2>My Homeland</h2>
            <h5>Cymru, the land of song!</h5>
            <p>
              Despite not having been born in Wales, I grew up here and consider
              it my true homeland. I'm proud of Cymru's rich history in the
              arts, as the birthplace of the welfare state in Britain, and of
              the people, who through thick and thin throughout the ages have
              fought to keep their identity alive
            </p>
            <p>
              Situated in the Western peninsula of Great Britain, Cymru is a
              land of valleys and mountains, rivers and ancient forests, and
              though they now lie silent, the mines deep within the earth used
              to hum with both song and great tragedy. Cymru and her people are
              survivors: We outlasted the Romans, the Saxons, the Normans, and
              stand as one of the oldest continuous lines of European nations.

            <h2>The Japanese Connection</h2>
            <h5>From one archipelago to another!</h5>
            <p>
              I began to study Japanese just before the end of Secondary School.
              Sadly, there were no Japanese classes I could take at school, and
              so I spent my time reading outdated textbooks from the local
              library and going to a night class a few towns over once a week.
            </p>
            <p>
              I began studying Japanese formally at Oxford Brookes University.
              In my third year, I studied abroad in Japan at the University of
              Yamanashi. During this and my final year, I matured and gained a
              boatload of self-confidence. After University, I worked as an
              English teacher in Fukushima Prefecture primary schools for 2
              years before coming to New Zealand to pursue further education.
            </p>
            <p>
              Japan is a beautiful country, and I am blessed to have met many
              wonderful people in my time there. I hope to return to Japan this
              year alongside mypartner in a more long-term capacity.

            <h2>Why am I studying at Dev Academy?</h2>
            <p>
              I've long suffered from an inability to choose a career path or
              decide what I wanted to be in the future. My initial job after
              graduation was teching English in Japan, but this was never meant
              to be a permanent career. After returning to New Zealand, I
              ping-ponged between jobs in construction, the university, and
              after-school tutoring, but nothing really stuck. Finally, after
              returning from a short study-abroad in Tokyo, I decided that I
              needed to settle on a career once and for all.
            </p>
            <p>
              After much head-scratching and soul-searching, I decided to pursue
              programming. Previously, I had been interested in this sort of
              career, and had tried on a few half-hearted occasions to learn by
              myself, however they never really led anywhere. I happened upon
              Dev Academy by chance, and after chatting with a few of the
              teachers and getting a tour of the Auckland Campus, I signed on
              and have been enjoying it immensely so far!

            <h2>Why Dev Academy in particular?</h2>
            <p>
              Nowadays, a career in the tech sector is a popular choice for many
              people, with the idea of being able to work remotely and gain
              competitive salaries compared to most other career paths. In
              response, many schools, bootcamps, online learning platforms and
              private individuals offer ways to learn different programming
              languages and 'kickstart a career in tech'. However, afer reading
              reviews and trawling through innumerable offers of 'quick hacks'
              and 'cheat codes' for learning programming skills, I decided to
              settle on Dev Academy Aoteroa. I made this decision because of a
              few factors:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Location: The Auckland Campus is practically a hop, skip and a
                jump down from my apartment.
              </li>
              <li>
                Financial Support: Compared to other schools/bootcamps, I was
                able to take advantage of Study Link to lighten the load.
              </li>
              <li>
                Career Support: Having access to Alumni and other advantages in
                job hunting are vital in the current job market.
              </li>
              <li>
                Intuition: After talking with Rohan and Joseph, and visiting the
                Auckland campus, I felt confident that DAA was the right place!

              Video Games can be amazing when made right, and I've been lucky
              enough to enjoy some amazingly relaxing and frustratingly
              challenging games over the years!
            </p>
            <p>
              I am extremely grateful for the experiences and relationships I
              have been able to build through them. Just last year, I was
              fortunate enough to meet a group of guys who I would form tight
              bonds with while playing World of Warcraft Classic.

            <h4>History</h4>
            <p>
              Since I was a child, I've always been fascinated in history!
              Growing up in Wales surrounded by castles and supplied with plenty
              of great books like the Horrible Histories series of books!
              Reading books, watching documentaries, and visiting historical
              sites whenever I get the chance, I just love learning more about
              every period of history there is!
