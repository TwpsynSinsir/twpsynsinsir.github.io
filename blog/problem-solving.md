1. were blocked on a simple problem:

### what was the problem?

I was blocked by the 2nd problem of the 4th kata challenge: Gradebook.
In this challenge, we were provided with 2 arrays named 'students' (containing student names), and 'scores' (containing scores pertaining to each student). The 2nd and 3rd questions asked us to add each students' name as properties within the new object 'gradebook', and then add their scores under a new property names 'testScores', each of which were under the students' names.

My problem was in finding how to add the info into the new object in their new properties while also extracting the information out of the original arrays.

what problem-solving techniques did you use?

Firstly, I tried to think through the steps I would need to take, and tried to visualise it. Next, I scoured the internet looking for different ways to transfer information from an array into an object. Lastly, when I was getting quite frustrated at my lack of progress, I reachout out to Joshua, our facilitator for help. Other students had found solutions to my problm, so between our facilitator and the other students, I was shown the solution.

how did you feel throughout the process?

I felt frustrated at first. I thought that I had a good grasp of how to manuipulate arrays and objects, but this challenge showed me that I still have a lot to learn. In hindsight, I had skipped through other resources that would have helped me in this particular problem. Upon finding the solution to the problem, I felt humbled, realising that I had been approaching the problem the wrong way. I also felt thankful that I had supportive mentors and peers around me to ask for help.

what did you learn?

I learned that I should make greater use of pseudocode to get my thoughts onto the screen. I also learned that I need to make better use of variables to define more confusing aspects when creating functions. Instead of dealing with multiple brackets to confuse my brain, I can condense the more abstract aspects into easier to read variables. Lastly, I learned not to be self-conscious about asking for help from my peers, which I've always had some problem with.

2. elegantly solved a problem.

### what was the problem?

The problem was the 'whereAreYou' problem from the 5th Kata challenge 'builtin-methods'. This problem asked me to find Scooby within an array of objects.

what problem-solving techniques did you use?

I followed the advice of the comments within the problem and looked at the test.js file, where I could see that within the array were objects of room numbers, within which were hiding objects, within one of which was Scooby.

I next looked up the .find()method and used it to find 'Scooby' within the hiding object, solving the problem.

how did you feel throughout the process?

I felt confident throughout this process. Looking at previous examples and extrapolating them onto my curret problem gave me a lot of confidence in my problem solving skills. This was a great boost after struggling on a few of the previous challenges!

what did you learn?

I learned that if I stay calm and analyse all of the resources at my disposal, I can solve initially difficult seeming problems.

3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:

Pseudocode
Trying something
Rubber ducky method
Reading error messages
Console.logging
Googling
Asking your peers for help
Asking coaches for help
Improving your process with reflection

4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
