          <h3>
            Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
            how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the
            decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
          </h3>
          <p>
            While I am fortunate enough not to have had to make any far-reaching
            ethical decisions, I always try to make sure that when I can I help
            'the little guy', whether that's trying to source local food or
            rejecting chain stores like Starbucks, or helping new players in
            video-games I play instead of focusing purely on my own advancement.
            I feel that I should always be helping others, or more acurately,
            that everyone should always help others. There are only a few times
            where I regret making these choices, and each one was when I myself
            had been deceived in the process. I am honestly glad that I have not
            had to make large, sweeping decisions that have affected many
            people.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm unsure if it counts as an ethical decision, but when I lived in
            Japan, I would always try to be a model citizen and help others in
            what little way I could, like giving up my seat on packed trains or
            saying hello while walking around in the countryside. How people
            view me as an outside will colour the way they treat others like me,
            so I believe it is the correct decision to play my part.

            I grew up in Cymru (Wales), and learned through the medium of Welsh
            for the whole of Secondary School (11-18 years old). I couldn't
            really pinpoint what was Welsh until I moved to England for
            University and felt like an outsider despite only having moved a few
            hundred kilometers East. I feel that a lot of my culture shock was
            from being from a rural Welsh village and suddenly being thrust into
            an English city; so much was different from my normal. I still miss
            the simplicity of rural life where communal connections mattered
            more and it feels that time passes by slower.
          </p>
          <p>
            From a young age I've been fascinated with history. I read
            non-fiction books from a young age and would love getting home to
            watch documentaries on the TV and play historical games on the PC.
            As I grew older and learned more, I grew to appreciate the
            complexity and breadth of the world's history. because of this, I
            like to think that I take a more open-minded view of events and
            peoples, understanding that people's morals and 'truths' are
            dictated by their upbringing and societies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The more I realised that identity and peoples values are dictated in
            large-part by things outside of our control, whether we want them to
            be or not, the less I cared about thinking too deeply on my own
            values and identity. I realised that despite valuing honesty, I
            would lie if it became advantageous for me to do so. I respected
            other peoples' opinions until they became too outlandish. My value
            is that I reject my values when they are no longer beneficial. I'm
            not sure what to think about that though, so I try not to. I suppose
            the one thing I truly value in all people, including myself, is a
            commitment to work in my best interests and the best interests of
            the community. Free Speech and tolerance of non-radical views are, I
            believe, sacrosanct in ensuring we can all work towards our best
            interests.

            My number one strength is my sense of humour and the ability not to
            take myself too seriously. I can laugh at stupid mistakes instead of
            getting bent out of shape. If an error is funny, I won't mind having
            made it. It's impossible to learn without making mistakes, so its a
            lot better to laugh at it than cry over a speedbump.

            My greatest limitation for learning is ADHD. Having been diagnosed
            last December, I've only recently begun to learn strategies and get
            medicine to help me concentrate for extended periods of time. Prior
            to this, I just assumed I was lazy, so the revelation that I've not
            just been lazy and bad at putting in effort my entire life is
            sort-of comforting, it doesn't change that I need to put in a lot of
            effort to sit down and learn properly.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am worried about being able to get in at the ground floor to a
            company because of my lack of experience in tech so far. I'm hoping
            that I can use my fluency in Japanese to offset that in some way.

          <p>
            During my time in University, I had to participate in a group
            project with other international students (In this case, I was also
            an international student). There was tension between each of us
            because of the different working philosophies from each of our
            cultures. From the first meeting, myself and another student worked
            to focus on emphasising the similarities of each of our methods and
            debating how each person could best utilise their particular methods
            for each part of the project. As a whole, this worked very well as
            we all wanted to do well on the project and our logic-driven
            arguments were devoid of ego and welcomed open discussion; having
            input from each member was key in rounding out our group-work
            strategy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sadly one member of the group felt attacked as their particular
            working-style emphasised creating work that was "good-enough" and
            disliked our collective decision to do the best we could to create
            the best work we could. As the group project was graded on
            individual achievement and merit, after trying to get them to
            participate and put more effort in, we warned them abou the
            individual grading style and kept them in communications with the
            rest of the group. Despite further appeals to the professor to try
            to motivate the individual, we decided to let them lie and reap what
            they sowed. As a result of this, they achieved a far lower grade
            than the rest of us, which they would blame on us not shoring up
            their shoddy work.
          </p>
          <p>
            In reflection, I feel that myself and the other members of the group
            did everything we should have correctly. I believe we worked
            efficiently and harmoneously, and were able to reach agreements and
            common grounds in all areas where tension arose. The common goal of
            achieving high marks and the satisfaction of creating work we could
            be proud of pushed us to do our best for ourselves and each other.
