          <h3>What is Neuroplasticity?</h3>
          <p>
            Neuroplasticity is the scientific belief that our brains are not
            hard-wired at birth (which was the common belief traditionally), but
            are better understood as a malleable plastic, where they change over
            time based on numerous factors. Harnessing this malleability, it is
            possible to make our brains increasingly resilient, and strengthen
            the connections and bonds within our minds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our brains are filled with uncountable neurons, each attached to
            countless others, creating a web of connectivity within our brains;
            connections that affect how we perceive and understand the world
            around us. Through strengthening these connections by practicing,
            einforcing ideas, and even creating new connections through changing
            the was in which we think about certain topics/challenges, we are
            reinforcing existing neural pathways into neural highways, greating
            increasing the speed and breadth of information able to connect our
            brains. Similarly, by changing the way we think about things, we are
            creating new pathways, possibly creating shortcuts, or unlocking
            different perspectives that we previously may never have considered.
          </p>

        <div class="topic">
          <h3>Explaining Neuroplasticity through Analogy.</h3>
          <p>
            As an analogy, imagine that the way in which we are taught to think
            in schools and growing up naturally as the age-old roads connecting
            local towns and villages. Our towns are surrounded by rivers,
            valleys, and mountains. The age-old roads go around the mountains,
            follow the valleys, and only cross the rivers at their shallowest
            points. The way in which we travel from Town A to Town B is set in
            stone, and takes a fixed time; we see the same sights each time,
            nothing really changing. However, the more we use the roads, the
            better they become, the more reinforced they are and the faster we
            can travel on them. In this way, we can incrementally improve the
            efficiency of our brains' thinking power.
          </p>
          <p>
            Harnessing neuroplasticity in this analogical world would be to
            question why, with all our modern technology, we have to use the
            hundreds of years old paths. Instead, we tunnel through a mountain,
            connecting two towns that may have been 2 hours apart originally,
            but now are 20 minutes apart thanks to our new tunnel pathway.
            Similarly, creating bridges over deep rivers and investing into more
            complicated infrastructure, the whole area can become interconnected
            like never before. Without having to go the old ways, new views are
            available, changing how we think about each connection in regards to
            each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            TIn conclusion, by being mindful of neuroplasticity, we can open our
            brains up to change, supercharging our minds for problem solving,
            now being able to look at each problem in new, out of the box ways.
            Continuous practice makes all connections stronger; by combining
            regular practice with mixing tasks together, we can both strengthen
            existing bonds and nurture new paths within our mind.

          <h3>What is a Growth Mindset?</h3>
          <p>
            In simple terms, a "Growth Mindset" is the belief that one can
            improve their abilities through effort and continuous practice. In
            essense, the belief that one can grow. The mistake many of us make,
            or are subjected to, is the belief that to fail something is the end
            of that journey. To fail a test is the end of that period in our
            lives. The study we did was not enough, and that's that. This is
            incredibly damaging to our ability to move forward; feeling that
            oneself is a failure is just setting oneself up for continued
            hardship as we will either push ourselves further until we hit our
            breaking point, or resign ourselves to mediocrity, fearing to dream
            of greater success lest we let ourselves down again by failing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Changing our perspective to viewing our continuing development as a
            journey laid out in front of us, with setbacks being viewed as "Not
            yet", rather than as "Failure" is a far kinder and supportive way to
            look at both our own lives and at others around us. Real strength is
            the perseverence to keep going, to keep developing ourselves so that
            each successive challenge can be overcome with less difficulty, and
            more can be learned each time we falter slightly. Learning from
            mistakes and recontextualising them into learning moments is vital
            for a continuous sense of forward movement and self-development.
          </p>
          <p>
            The human mind is an extraordinarily powerful and complex thing. We
            know from the placebo effect that simply by thinking that something
            is occuring, our mainds can often begin the transformation process
            because we believe it is happening. This is easiest to see in the
            use of placebo drugs, which are simply sugar capsules rather than
            actual medicine. However, if the patient believes they are taking
            real medicine, they will often begin the healing process. utilising
            this concept in simple ways by convincing ourselves of our
            developmental journey before us is a powerful tool to help defeat
            defeatism and encourage positive thinking!
