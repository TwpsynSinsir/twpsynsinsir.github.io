          <h3>My long term goals and career pathway</h3>
          <p>
            My long term goal is to begin a career in software development, and
            possibly expanding into data science if the opportunity arises. I
            have struggled to find a proper career path that is both satisfying
            and offers upwards mobility, therefore I am commited to make this
            journey into software.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another long term goal is to grow a career where I am able to live
            and work in Japan alongside my partner. Having met and previously
            lived together in Japan, we both feel that between New Zealand and
            Japan, the latter is the better place to settle down long term due
            to career opportunities, family, and cost of living. I'm currently
            hoping to achieve this by either getting a job with a Japanese
            company/startup, or in a remote working position for a New Zealand
            based employer.

          <h3>My strength and limitations in learning</h3>
          <p>
            My main strengths and weaknesses both come from my ADHD. I can
            lock-in and focus on whatever I am currently interested in, such as
            learning new and simpler methods of organising web-pages and writing
            code. As long as I am interested or see value in something, I can
            passionately work and push myself harder than most of my peers.
            However, this is a double-edged sword, and I can burn myself out
            without realising it, and focus on things that I find interesting
            but aren't actually important to my learning. This includes getting
            distracted by frivolous things and having 5 minute breaks turned
            into 30 minutes of watching meaningless videos or suddenly deciding
            my apartment needs a makeover at 11pm.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have only recently been diagnosed with ADHD, so I am still
            learning how best to manage it in my daily life. Up until now, I
            have just assumed that I was lazy and unable to concentrate on
            anything important (despite being able to focus heavily on things I
            am very interested in). I am beginning to get medicated and trying
            to balance exercise with the medication and self-management through
            mindfulness and other tactics I'm still learning. Additionally, I
            need to manage my unfortunate want for perfectionism, which is
            apparently also tied to ADHD. I've already learnt while making this
            blog that I tend to focus on things that are not that important such
            as perfecting a navbar instead of actually writing the blog itself.

            The non-technical and human skills I'd like to develop at
            DevAccademy
          </h3>
          <p>
            I would like to develop good working skills in regards to
            cooperating with others on software projects. I have had prior
            experiences working with others on larger overall projects within
            the University of Auckland, however I believe the dynamic is very
            different on software projects. As this is the first large
            undertaking since I was diagnosed with ADHD, I'd also like to learn
            how to manage my time and utilise the benefits that my condition
            presents me if I can control it.

          <h3>My commitments to managing my workload</h3>
          <p>
            I want to commit myself to working each day following a principle of
            working in sprints, each trying to focus on a specific aspect of the
            code I'm working on. I believe that by subdividing the work I have
            in front of me, I can manage my own expectations and lower the
            potential stress I may feel from taking on projects that feel
            unasailable from the start-line.
          </p>
          <p>
            I want to make sure that I don't push myself too hard and burn
            myself out due to my ADHD overfixation on my work. I worry that by
            pushing myself too far I will not only burn myself out, but
            negatively affect the moods of other learners around me. I would
            like to maintain a professional but friendly attitude when
            interacting with the rest of the cohort, the facilitatirs, and any
            and all industry/community representatives. I want to be mindful of
            those around me and work together on projects without getting
            competitive and feeling that I have to compete aggresively with my
            peers.

          <h3>My commitment not to suffer in silence</h3>
          <p>
            I've learnt from bad experiences that if I don't seek help I will
            self-destruct in an awful way that has derailed me in the past. I
            have no qualms with seeking help from facilitatirs and DevAcademy
            staff while I am learning here. I would prefer to contact staff
            privately away from the rest of the learners, partly from slight
            embarrassment, but mostly because I do not want others to be
            affected by me seeking help in a negative way. I would have no
            trouble helping others seek help if they also felt in a bad way.

          <h3>What I expect from the facilitation team</h3>
          <p>
            I expect the facilitators to be able to help me with most
            run-of-the-mill problems I'll have at DevAcademy. In addition, I
            expect them to be polite and happy to help out the learners with
            their learning journey and offer tips on how to improve our code. At
            the end of the day, the facilitators are humans, just like me, so I
            won't expect them to perform miracles, but I would love to create
            strong bonds with them and learn from their experience.

          <h3>My prior commitments and "block-out" times</h3>
          <p>
            While I don't have any times where I'll be fully blocked-out of
            learning during the bootcamp period, I still have most of a week
            left of my current night-shift job. So far this has got in the way
            of my foundations learning by distrupting my daily study plans. I'm
            hoping that any potential block-outs from part-time work are
            consistent each week so I can plan around them rather than being
            random.
