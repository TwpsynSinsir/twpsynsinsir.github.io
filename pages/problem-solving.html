            <h2>When was I blocked on a simple problem?</h2>
            <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
            <p>
              I was blocked by the 2nd problem of the 4th kata challenge:
              Gradebook. In this challenge, we were provided with 2 arrays named
              'students' (containing student names), and 'scores' (containing
              scores pertaining to each student).
            </p>
            <p>
              The 2nd and 3rd questions asked us to add each students' name as
              properties within the new object 'gradebook', and then add their
              scores under a new property names 'testScores', each of which were
              under the students' names.
            </p>
            <p>
              My problem was in finding how to add the info into the new object
              in their new properties while also extracting the information out
              of the original arrays.
            </p>
            <h4>What problem-solving techniques did I use?</h4>
            <p>
              Firstly, I tried to think through the steps I would need to take,
              and tried to visualise it. Next, I scoured the internet looking
              for different ways to transfer information from an array into an
              object. Lastly, when I was getting quite frustrated at my lack of
              progress, I reachout out to Joshua, our facilitator for help.
              Other students had found solutions to my problm, so between our
              facilitator and the other students, I was shown the solution.
            </p>
            <h4>How did I feel throughout the process?</h4>
            <p>
              I felt frustrated at first. I thought that I had a good grasp of
              how to manuipulate arrays and objects, but this challenge showed
              me that I still have a lot to learn. In hindsight, I had skipped
              through other resources that would have helped me in this
              particular problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon finding the solution to the problem, I felt humbled,
              realising that I had been approaching the problem the wrong way. I
              also felt thankful that I had supportive mentors and peers around
              me to ask for help.
            </p>
            <h4>What did I learn?</h4>
            <p>
              I learned that I should make greater use of pseudocode to get my
              thoughts onto the screen. I also learned that I need to make
              better use of variables to define more confusing aspects when
              creating functions. Instead of dealing with multiple brackets to
              confuse my brain, I can condense the more abstract aspects into
              easier to read variables. Lastly, I learned not to be
              self-conscious about asking for help from my peers, which I've
              always had some problem with.

            <h2>When I elegantly solved a problem</h2>
            <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
            <p>
              The problem was the 'whereAreYou' problem from the 5th Kata
              challenge 'builtin-methods'. This problem asked me to find Scooby
              within an array of objects.
            </p>
            <h4>What problem-solving techniques did I use?</h4>
            <p>
              I followed the advice of the comments within the problem and
              looked at the test.js file, where I could see that within the
              array were objects of room numbers, within which were hiding
              objects, within one of which was Scooby.
            </p>
            <p>
              I next looked up the .find()method and used it to find 'Scooby'
              within the hiding object, solving the problem.
            </p>
            <h4>How did I feel throughout the process?</h4>
            <p>
              I felt confident throughout this process. Looking at previous
              examples and extrapolating them onto my curret problem gave me a
              lot of confidence in my problem solving skills. This was a great
              boost after struggling on a few of the previous challenges!
            </p>
            <h4>What did I learn?</h4>
            <p>
              I learned that if I stay calm and analyse all of the resources at
              my disposal, I can solve initially difficult seeming problems.

              Reflecting on a time I was reluctant to ask for help, what made me
              so reluctant to do so, and what I may try differently next time.
            </h2>
            <h4>Struggling with my self-confidence</h4>
            <p>
              I was initially reluctant to ask for help when tackling the
              gradebook challenge. I think I was reluctant to do so for 2 main
              reasons: Firstly, I felt confident in arrays and objects, so I
              thought that I should be able to tackle these problems without
              help. Secondly, I saw other students already tackling and asking
              questions about the next challenges, so I felt self-conscious when
              I believed others must have tackled this challenge with ease.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the future, I won't allow myself to feel self-conscious about
              asking for help. I've overcome this in the past, but it feels that
              I have to do so again and again each time I begin at a new
              institution.

            <h2>
              Reflecting on how confident I feel using each of these
              problem-solving techniques/processes:
            </h2>
            <h4>Pseudocode:</h4>
            <p>
              3/10 - I didn't make good use of Pseudocode at the beginning, but
              after seeing how useful it was, and how my peers had been making
              good use of it, I want to make far greater use of Pseudocode.
            </p>
            <h4>Trying something:</h4>
            <p>
              7/10 - I feel quite confident at trying something. I feel that if
              I don't try anything, I will just remain stuck where I am.
            </p>
            <h4>Rubber ducky method:</h4>
            <p>
              8/10 - I found this method really helpful! While I made a cup of
              tea, talking in turn to each instrument I was using helped me
              logically explain it. It was also quite fun having a conversation
              with my kettle about writing in JS.
            </p>
            <h4>Reading error messages:</h4>
            <p>
              7/10 - I feel that I got a lot better at reading and understanding
              what the error messages were trying to tell me over this week's
              kata challenges. It helped me stumble into how important using
              'var' or 'let' is for defining variables!
            </p>
            <h4>Console.logging:</h4>
            <p>
              10/10 - I feel very confident in using console.logging, and it has
              helped me a lot through these kata challenges.
            </p>
            <h4>Googling:</h4>
            <p>
              10/10 - I have relied on google a lot to look up different methods
              and problems that I was facing. Ive spend far too long trawling
              MDN, Stackoverflow amongst others to not get a good grasp of how
              to hone in on the answers and how to ask the right questions.
            </p>
            <h4>Asking my peers for help:</h4>
            <p>
              8/10 - I've got a lot better at doing this over the last week. I
              had been self-conscious before, but everyone has been so
              supportive, and to know that they also struggled at times was
              somewhat conforting to me.
            </p>
            <h4>Asking coaches for help:</h4>
            <p>
              8/10 - Similarly to asking me peers for help, I've realised that
              when I'm in a tight spot, it's always okay to reach out to my
              facilitator!
            </p>
            <h4>Improving my process with reflection:</h4>
            <p>
              6/10 - I think I still need to get better at improving my
              processes with reflection. I can be somewhat stubborn at times and
              fail to pick up on important lessons that would help me greatly.

            <h2>Arrays and Objects</h2>
            <h4>Storage Wars</h4>
            <p>
              Arrays and Objects are both used to store collections of data in
              javascript. The difference lies in how they each store this data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Arrays store data in consecutive memory locations, which is a
              fancy way of saying each item is numbered, starting at 0. Arrays
              are useful when the items we wish to store have only one value, or
              that the order in which they are numbered also matters.
            </p>
            <img src="/images/arrays.png" alt="An example of an array" />
            <p>
              Objects store data in key-value pairs, so each key may hold more
              than one node of data. Objects are very useful when we need to
              assign more than one value to each item. During the creation of
              our Javascript cafe, each item on the menu is an object, with that
              item's stock and cost linked to each object.

            <h2>What are Functions?</h2>
            <h4>What's their function?</h4>
            <p>
              A function is a code snippet that can be called by other code or
              itself. Arguments (values) are passed through the function as
              inputs, from which the function returns outputs. Below, we can see
              that we have 2 functions, within each are conditionals, variables,
              and loops.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the function is called, the inputs are inputted, and the
              function runs everything through to give us the correct output.
