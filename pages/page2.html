      <h2>Chosen Topic: Inline vs Inline Block</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          HTML elements have a default display value. They are either inline or
          block-level elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Block-level elements start on a new line, and take up the full width
          available. Examples include: headings (h1, h2, etc.), div, p.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, inline elements do not start a new line, and their width is
          limited to only what is needed. Examples include: span, a, img.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Inline and Block examples:</h2>
        <div id="block">block element</div>
        <span>inline element</span>
        <p>
          As you can see above, the block element has taken up the entire space
          provided and started on a new line, whereas the span element is
          self-contained and continued on the same line.
        </p>
        <p>
          As mentioned above, inline and block are the default elements assigned
          to HTML elements. With CSS, it is possible to change the default
          setting of elements using the "display" function. We can assign
          usually inline elements like images to be "block", and ususally block
          elements like paragraphs to be "inline".
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also possible, using CSS, to assign height and width parameters
          to both block and inline elements. However, these will not affect
          inline elements, as they are hardcoded to only take up the required
          area. Therein comes "inline block" elements.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Inline Block examples:</h2>
        <h4 class="block">Hello, I'm a block element!</h4>
        <h4 class="inline">Hello, I'm an inline element!</h4>
        <h4 class="inline-block">Hello, I'm an inline-block element!</h4>
        <p>
          Each of the above elements have been given a background colour and a
          height of 50px.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can see that the block has without a width being set, the block
          element has taken up the entire space provided. The inline and
          inline-block elements have only taken up the width necessary for their
          contents, but the inline element has not been affected by the height
          setting.
        </p>
      </div>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
