          <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
          <p>
            Emotional Intelligence (EI) - also known as "Emotional Quotient"
            (EQ) - is defined as: "the capacity to be aware of, control, and
            express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships
            judiciously, and empathetically."
          </p>
          <p>
            To have a high amount of EI means that you are in control of your
            emotions, not a slave to them. Whether that be in full control of
            your anger so that you do not fly off the handle at an insignificant
            problem, the ability to properly empathise and understand what
            another person is feeling, or the ability to express your emotions
            clearly to yourself and others.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="topic">
          <h3>Why is Emotional Intelligence important?</h3>
          <p>
            Other than the obvious benefit of being able to understand the
            complex emotions we all go through on the day-to-day, EI is an
            important skill to master to help with conflict management and clear
            communication. Whether at home, or at work, these skills are key to
            living a happy, fulfilling life while avoiding stressful situations.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I hope everyone who is reading this immediately understands
            how vital EI is for our domestic and personal lives, how EI helps us
            all in the workplace may be less immediately obvious.
          </p>
          <p>
            The workplace is fundamentally different to our home lives. We must
            work with people who are initally complete strangers, who's beliefs
            and habits may clash with our own. It is in these situations that EI
            is so important to lessen conflict and help us understand one
            another. Empathy and understanding are crucial for teamwork to
            blossom.

          <h3>How can we improve our Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
          <p>
            This may seem daunting at first, but there are a few ways in which
            we can improve our EI in non-intrusive ways. Taking a breath and
            slowing down to process emotions such as anger or frustration can
            really help by giving us the opportunity to think: "Why am I
            angry?", "Can I change anything to improve my situation?", or "Is
            there something I can say right now to explain my emotions to those
            around me?"
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding our strengths and weaknesses can also help immensely.
            Personally, I know that I can be hot-headed and prone to anger when
            a process or inanimate object does not do what I expect it to do. By
            this, I mean that I can get very frustrated at heaters that do not
            heat; at knives that do not cut; or at routers that do not connect
            properly. On the other hand, I also have a lot of patience and
            empathy for any mistakes made by people around me, and undestand
            that they may have simply made a mistake rather than acted
            maliciously. Understanding this, I have found that assigning
            personalities to some more frustrating items helps me become less
            irritated at them.

          <h3>IQ vs EQ: What's the difference?</h3>
          <p>
            From an early age, many of us have heard of IQ (Intelligence
            Quotient), and have a vague understanding that it's related to how
            intelligent someone is. Far fewer of us have heard of EQ (Emotional
            Quotient), which is another way to say Emotional Intelligence (EI).
            In the most simple terms, IQ is related to our analytical brain,
            whereas EQ is related to our holistic brain.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can think of IQ as a traditional view of intelligence, measuring
            cognitive ability and logical reasoning. This is easier to measure
            through standardised tests and easily spotted through individuals'
            logical reasoning, working memory, and problem-solving skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            EQ/IE on the other hand, is a more modern view of intelligence,
            measuring social skills, empathy, and self-awareness. This can be
            harder to measure conclusively compared to IQ, however unlike IQ, EI
            can be developed and improved over time. Improving our EI is always
            a good idea, as it helps us in almost every aspect of life.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="topic">
          <h3>The interplay of IQ and EQ</h3>
          <p>
            As far as we currently know, we are stuck with the IQ that we have,
            but that doesn't define our intelligence. This traditional idea of
            intelligence is not enough to achieve success all by itself. We
            require EI to manage our stress and emotions, and to help
            communicate with other people.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is little benefit in being able to easily solve difficult
            analytical problems without the emotional capacity to manage the
            stress that comes from pushing oneself through the stress of doing
            such a thing. To have no EI is to be lonely, as one may lack the
            ability to form relationships with those around us.
