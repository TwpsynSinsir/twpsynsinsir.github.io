            <h2>Javascript and its relationship with HTML and CSS</h2>
            <h4>Coding the body</h4>
            <p>
              HTML is the skeleton of the webpage, laying out the structure and
              creates a (pun intended) bare-bones shape for the webpage. CSS is
              the flashy exterior, affecting the colours, shapes, and overall
              layout of the page. Javascript adds functionality and
              interactivity to the webpage. Through javascript, elements move,
              change, and interact with hidden orders behind the scene.
            </p>
            <p>
              To better imagine how these three work in concert, a good analogy
              would be the human body: HTML is the bones, CSS is the body-type,
              weight, hair, eye-colour etc., and Javascript is the brain and
              tendons, allowing the body to move and change.
            </p>

            <h2>The Control Flow, Conditionals, and Loops</h2>
            <h4>An everyday analogy</h4>
            <p>
              Control flow, simply, is the order in which the computer executes
              statements in a script. The code is run in order from the first
              line in the file to the last line, unless this is affected by
              structures that change this flow, such as conditionals and loops.
            </p>
            <p>
              An example to better articulate this would be to imagine control
              flow as the passage of time from when we wake in the morning, to
              when we sleep at night. Conditionals such as "if" and "else" would
              be used for hunger, thirst, showering, and exercise. If we are
              hungry, we should eat. Otherwise, we shouldn't eat. These
              conditionals are, funnily enough, conditional on something being
              true or not.
            </p>
            <p>
              A loop, meanwhile, is a little more complicated. Unlike a simple
              binary decision, a loop is a sequence of instructions that are
              repeated until a certain condition is met. As a student, we could
              imagine a loop in our daily lives being to check whether our
              assignments for that day have been completed, and if not, undergo
              all the required work until they are. This would then repeat each
              day as long as there is work to be done. Another analogy would be
              to tidy our living areas if it had reached a threshold of being
              too dirty/cluttered.

            <h2>What is the DOM, exactly?</h2>
            <h4>And why is it useful?</h4>
            <p>
              The Document Object Model, or DOM for short, is the data
              representation of the objects that make up the structure and
              content of a webpage document. The easiest way to interact with
              and view the DOM is to Right Click any webpage and select
              'inspect', followed by selecting the 'Console' view.
            </p>
            <p>
              From this Console view, we can write javascript functions to
              affect the rest of the webpage (Only temporarily, a refresh will
              remove and changed made). However, as a programmer using
              javascript, this view is most useful while writing a script; as a
              back-end language, it can be difficult to see if functions are
              working as they should. Therefore, using a console.log() to check
              if our code is actually creating change is a quick and easy way to
              avoid accidentally writing bad code that isn't properly connected
              to the HTML document.

            <h2>Arrays and Objects</h2>
            <h4>Storage Wars</h4>
            <p>
              Arrays and Objects are both used to store collections of data in
              javascript. The difference lies in how they each store this data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Arrays store data in consecutive memory locations, which is a
              fancy way of saying each item is numbered, starting at 0. Arrays
              are useful when the items we wish to store have only one value, or
              that the order in which they are numbered also matters.
            </p>
            <img src="/images/arrays.png" alt="An example of an array" />
            <p>
              Objects store data in key-value pairs, so each key may hold more
              than one node of data. Objects are very useful when we need to
              assign more than one value to each item. During the creation of
              our Javascript cafe, each item on the menu is an object, with that
              item's stock and cost linked to each object.
            </p>

            <h2>What are Functions?</h2>
            <h4>What's their function?</h4>
            <p>
              A function is a code snippet that can be called by other code or
              itself. Arguments (values) are passed through the function as
              inputs, from which the function returns outputs. Below, we can see
              that we have 2 functions, within each are conditionals, variables,
              and loops.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the function is called, the inputs are inputted, and the
              function runs everything through to give us the correct output.
